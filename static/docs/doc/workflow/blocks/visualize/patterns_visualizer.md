# Patterns visualizer

* Category: Visualize

## Inputs

* patterns [[ComoduleSet](../../../data_types.html#comoduleset)]
* edges [[Edges](../../../data_types.html#edges)]
* diff_expr [[DiffExpr](../../../data_types.html#diffexpr)]

## Parameters



## Outputs



## Description

  visualizes the comodules found in pattern search in terms of their PPI edges, each comodule (defined as a set of elements) gets projected on the prior defined interaction network (graph) and plotted, in the plot, all the PPI interactions whose both vertices appear in the comodule get plotted, the vertices are colored in terms of their differential expression, for this reason, expression set makes the input too
