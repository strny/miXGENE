# Classifier

 provides a set of classification algorithms that produce (phenotype) predictive models, each classifier has train and test sets on its input, learns a model based on the train data and tests the model on the test set, both train and test sets represent a numeric matrix that gives feature values in a set of samples (typically gene expression, methylation or miRNA assays) complete by a discrete class vector, some classifiers work with additional inputs that help them to utilize prior knowledge
