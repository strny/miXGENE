## Description

  implements the method of network-regularized multiple non-negative matrix factorization (SNMNMF). a data integration method to identify the miRNAâ€“gene regulatory comodules, the method stems from mRNA and miRNA expression sets including their prior known interactions and generates a set of matrices vaguely representing regulatory comodules, i.e., the sets of mRNAs and miRNAs that tend to agree in their expression profiles and interact in terms of the prior knowledge
